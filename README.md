- **Account Login**: Ensure you're logged into your WhatsApp account on the browser.

## ‚öô Configuration

Before executing the script, you might want to adjust its configuration:

- **Selectors**:
  - `SEND_BUTTON_SELECTOR`: Finds the send button on WhatsApp Web.
  - `TEXTAREA_SELECTOR`: Finds the message input area.

> üìù Note: These selectors are pre-configured. However, if WhatsApp modifies their web structure in the future, you might need to adjust them.

- **Execution Timing**:
  - `EXECUTE_IMMEDIATELY`: Determines whether the script runs immediately (`true`) or waits for a scheduled time (`false`).
  - `TARGET_HOUR`, `TARGET_MINUTE`, `TARGET_SECOND`: Schedule the message. For 2:30:53 PM, set the values to 14, 30, and 53 respectively.

- **Message Content**:
  - `MESSAGE_TEXT`: Here's where you input your message. Separate lines with line breaks for multiple messages.

## üì© Sending the Messages

Once you've executed the script, it will either:
- Send the messages immediately.
- Wait for the scheduled time (based on `EXECUTE_IMMEDIATELY`).

## üõë Cancelling Scheduled Messages

Changed your mind about sending the messages? No problem!

If you've set the script to dispatch messages at a certain time but wish to cancel, use the following command in the console:

```javascript
cancelSending();
```
